# ChatProgram2

Could potentially develop further to create more IRC instances with their own chat channels. Would need very little effort to do so, but will need to move the management console of into some kind of master console for control.

In reflection:
Definitely needs better version control, one feature at a time. Better than the last one in terms of readability and complexity, but still lacking in documentation (self-study after all).

This uses the Boost dependency, which involved lots of reading into other people's work. That was the main idea here, understanding how it can be mingled together with my own code. Overall, it's an okay project. Will need a more advanced and deeper one.

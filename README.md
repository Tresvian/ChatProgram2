# ChatProgram2

Needs: add authenticator to IRC

Needs: exit handling.

Needs: IRC has an interactable console for issueing messages/commands. 

Could potentially create more IRC instances with their own chat channels. Would need very little effort to do so, but will need to move the management console.

In reflection:
Definitely needs better version control, one feature at a time. Better than the last one in terms of readability and complexity, but still lacking in documentation (self-study after all).
